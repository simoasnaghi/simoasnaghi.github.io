      <description>My name is Simone Asnaghi. I’m 24 years old and I’m an electronics engineer. Currently, I’m enrolled in the master course of Electronics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. I have a lot of passions, but the main ones are basketball and motorsport. My dream job is to become an engineer for an F1 team. Meanwhile, I work on my personal skills and take advantage of every opportunity that life gives me.</description>
