<p>My name is Simone Asnaghi. </p>

<p>I’m 24 years old and I’m an electronics engineering. Currently, I’m enrolled in the master course of Electronics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. I have lot of passions, but the main ones are basketball and motorsport. My dream job is to become an engineer for an F1 team. Meanwhile, I work on my personal skills and take advantage of every opportunity that life gives me. On these pages, you can find something related to my work. I hope you will enjoy your virtual tour.</p>
