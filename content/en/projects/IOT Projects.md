1.  **[Challenge 2](https://github.com/simoasnaghi/Challenge2-IOT)**  
      This repo contains my solution to the second challenge of the IoT course (ay 2021/2022).  
      The objective of the challenge: read data from a CSV by importing it into node-red, then extract only 100 values for field1, field2, and field5. The extraction is based on the person code. Last step export data from node-red to thingspeak by using mqtt communication protocol.  
2.  **[Challenge 3](https://github.com/simoasnaghi/Challenge3-IOT)**  
      This repo contains my solution to the third challenge of the IoT course (ay 2021/2022).  
      The objective of the challenge: Create a mote in tiny-os that make the led blink to create the code in base 3 of the personal code.  
3.  **[Challenge 4](https://github.com/simoasnaghi/Challenge4-IOT)**  
      This repo contains my solution to the fourth challenge of the IoT course (ay 2021/2022).  
      The objective of the challenge: create an application that provides a way of communication for two motes. Then a simulation performed with TOSSIM is launched and in total it exchanges a finite number of messages based on the personal code, whereas also the startup of the second mote in the simulation is based on the person code.
