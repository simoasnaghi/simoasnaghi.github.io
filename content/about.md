**My name is Simone Asnaghi.**  

I'm 25 years old and I'm an electronics engineer. Currently, I'm enrolled in the master course in Electronics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. I have a lot of passions, but the main ones are basketball and motorsport. My dream job is to become an engineer for an F1 team. Meanwhile, I work on my skills and take advantage of every opportunity life gives me. On these pages, you can find something related to my work. I hope you will enjoy your virtual tour.
